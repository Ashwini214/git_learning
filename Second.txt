a. How git workflow works?
  Git workflow has 4 fundamental stages: 
  i.   Workspace: Working Directory 
  ii.  Index (Stage): It is used as a staging area between working directory and your repository
  iii. Local Repository is the one on which we will make local changes, generally Local Repository is on our computer.
  iv.  Remote Repository is the one of the server.

b. What're the different stages of a git project as commit, add?
   Git project have 3 different stages
   i.   Modified: Once, the code is written in repository, anyone wants to make some modification can make those changes in their own remote repository.This is called Modification, i.e. making some additions to the original project.
   ii.  Staged: So, after making changes to the project without hampering the original version, but how do we apply those changes to our remote repository? So, we use the commands in the Git command line â€” git add. So, this command tracks the new changes and pushes it to the staging area where all the new files are finally ready to be joined to the remote repository.
   iii. Commit: This is the final stage, as this stage finally applies the new changes to the remote repository. commit is a set of new files that are being added to a project as part of the modification.

c. Is it possible to do a git commit before git add. If you have made any changes? Explain why?
   No, it is not possible to do git commit before git add. As per git workflow the file must be added to the index or staging area and then it must committed.Because when commit applies this simply means that you have successfully applied a certain modification to the code.

d. Why is git diff used?
   diff command is used in git to track the difference between the changes made on a file.

e. Can we leave the commit message as blank?
   Yes we can leave the commit message as blank and iCan we leave the commit message as blank?t can be done by using the command: git commit -a --allow-empty-message -m ""
